PROPERTIES:

color,background-color:  rgb( , , )(range=0 to 255)
                         #------(in hexdecimal system)(#fc9; /* same as #ffcc99 */)

                         rgba( a for transparency 0.0 to 1.0 )

opacity: The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:

background-image: By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
                  background-image: url("paper.gif");                  
background-repeat: repeat-x( to repeat horizontally)
                   repeat-y
                   no-repeat
backround-position:top bottom left right center ( can have two values with a space )
background-attachment: property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):
                       fixed
                       scroll
background-size: auto|length|cover|contain|initial|inherit;(https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.php)   
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration: (background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;)

              double - Defines a double border
              groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
              ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
              inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
              outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
              none - Defines no border
              hidden - Defines a hidden border
              top right bottom left
              top,bottom right,left

border-width: (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) thin medium thick
              top right bottom left

border-color: top right bottom left
              top,bottom right,left
The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:
border-width
border-style (required)
border-color	
      
border-radius: for rounded borders

The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left 
If the margin property has three values:
margin: 25px 50px 75px;
top margin is 25px
right and left margins are 50px
bottom margin is 75px
If the margin property has two values:
margin: 25px 50px;
top and bottom margins are 25px
right and left margins are 50px

You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.
The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

inherit value :be inherited from the parent element 

Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

height,width : auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
               length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
               % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
               initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
               inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.
The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).
The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.
Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset(The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent)
outline

text-align: center right left
text-align-last: right center justify
direction: rtl ltr
unicode-bidi: bidi-override
vertical-align:

text-decoration-line: overline line-through underline 
text-decoration-color: color of text-decoration-line 
text-decoration-style
text-decoration-thickness
text-decoration-( https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_decoration.asp )
All links in HTML are underlined by default. Sometimes you see that links are styled with no underline. The text-decoration: none; is used to remove the underline from links, like this:

text-transform: uppercase lowercase capitalize

text-indent: property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text:
letter-spacing:  property is used to specify the space between the characters in a text.
line-height: property is used to specify the space between lines:
word-spacing: property is used to specify the space between the words in a text.

text-shadow: property adds shadow to text. (2px 2px;) (2px 2px red;) (2px 2px 5px red;)can have multiple values seperated by a comma

font-family: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma.
font-style: normal italic oblique
font-weight: normal bold
font-variant: normal small-caps(In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.)
font-size: Absolute size
 	   Relative size
           The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".
The font property is a shorthand property for:
font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font-size/line-height
font-family

Links: a:link - a normal, unvisited link
       a:visited - a link the user has visited
       a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
       a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

cursor: ( https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp )

Lists: list-style-type: circle square disc none
       list-style-position: outside inside
       list-style-image

Tables: border
        border-collapse
        width
        th,td-height
              text-align
              vertical-align(top bottom middle)
              padding
        border-bottom
        element:hover
        tr:nth-child(even)
        Add a container element (like <div>) with overflow-x:auto around the <table> element to make it responsive:(<div style="overflow-x:auto;">)(A responsive table will display a horizontal scroll bar if the screen is too small to display the full content. Resize the browser window to see the effect:)
	
position: static
          relative
          fixed
          absolute
          sticky

z-index: The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others)

overflow: The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
          visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
          hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
          scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
          auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
overflow-x,overflow-y

float: left
       right
       none
       inherit
clear: When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.
       none
       left
       right
       both
       inherit
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:
( .clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
})

box-sizing: border-box; We also use the box-sizing property to make sure that the box doesn't break due to extra padding. Try to remove this code to see the effect.

margin: auto; -To horizontally center a block element (like <div>)
